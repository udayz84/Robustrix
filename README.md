# Robustrix Site — React + Vite

This project reproduces the look-and-feel (layout, hero, transitions, responsive behavior) of the AAEON home page using React, modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid), and zero animation libraries. It uses only React/Vite; all animations and interactions are handcrafted.

Important: No proprietary assets, logos, or copy are included. All images are local or placeholders designed to emulate composition and motion only.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open the printed local URL (e.g. http://localhost:5173).

3. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

## Tech
- React 18 + Vite
- CSS variables, Grid, Flexbox
- IntersectionObserver for scroll-in animations
- No external UI/animation/dependency libraries

## Notes
- Fonts: system stack to avoid external font hosting
- Images: local SVG placeholders (feel free to replace with your own)
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation for the hero carousel; semantic landmarks and controls

## Structure
- `src/components` — header, hero carousel, sections, footer
- `src/styles` — variables and base/global/animation styles
- `public/assets` — placeholder SVGs
